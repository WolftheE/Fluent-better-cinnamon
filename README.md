# A Fork of the Fluent theme
## Adds better cinnamon support to this theme

![main](screenshot/thumbnail.png)

It adds 
- themed osd
- dialog/popups
- darker menus
- thinner font on panel

Just like in the gnome shell version

To install just overwrite the folders `cinnamon` and `gtk-3.0` into the themes folder of `Fluent-Dark` in `~/.themes`(make sure that you have install Fluent first!)
